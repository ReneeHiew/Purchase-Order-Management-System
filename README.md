# Purchase-Order-Management-System
Group Assignment (Year 2 - Semester 1)
The Purchase Order Management System was developed by two members over three months using object-oriented programming techniques in the Java programming language. 
There are 3 types of users in this system: purchase manager, sales manager, and admin.
Each user has different and unique features that can only be accessed by the respective user.
In general, every user should log in to the system with their respective username and password.
The system will then verify the user's credentials based on user data stored in the text files, identify their respective roles, and assign them to their respective home page. 
Each user can perform actions that are accessible by them through feature buttons on their respective homepage.
Additionally, this system implements a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for the user interface.
